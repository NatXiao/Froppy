# Froppy, a game with a cute little frog

This project was made by Natasha Landry and Seven Raymond.

### What does our game contains : 

- A menu
- A Leaderboard, where the 5 bests scores are displayed (all your attempt are stocked in the game, we keep everything!)
- A Settings screen, where you can change the appearance of the game if you want a funny reference to our school
- The game

### How to play?

You play as a frog who wants to jump from water lily to the next. The waterlilies rotate, so you have to wait for the right moment to jump! Press the space bar to jump.

Be careful, the distances are changing!

### How to launch the game : 
Go to [`ScreenSelector`](src/window/ScreenSelector)

### More info
Our game is mainly in `src/window`, but our classes are in `src/ch/hevs/gdx2d` directory. All our images, fonts or shaders are in `data`

Here is a small preview of our game :
